# Heart-disease-analysis
This study focuses on predicting disease outcomes using a diverse healthcare dataset, emphasizing the impact of health and lifestyle factors on disease risk. Missing data underscores the need for robust imputation methods in healthcare predictions.

Domain Knowledge 📚

- **Age**: The patient's age plays a pivotal role in disease prognosis, with an increased risk of conditions like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and arthritis as one grows older. This elevated risk results from cumulative exposure to risk factors, physiological changes, and increased wear and tear on the body. 🌡️👴

- **Sex**: The patient's gender impacts disease prognosis due to biological disparities and gender-specific lifestyle choices. For instance, males are more prone to heart disease, while females face a higher risk of skin cancer, possibly due to factors like longevity and distinct risk factor exposures. ♀️♂️

- **General Health**: Patients' self-rated health status (e.g., "Poor" or "Fair") correlates with an increased likelihood of chronic conditions. This may be linked to how these conditions affect their perceived health. 💓

- **Checkup**: The frequency of health checkups influences disease prognosis, as regular checkups aid in early detection and management, ultimately improving outcomes. 🏥

- **Exercise**: Whether a patient engages in regular exercise impacts disease risk. Exercise helps with weight control, lowers the risk of heart diseases, and regulates blood sugar and insulin levels, explaining the inverse correlation with diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. 🏃‍♂️🏋️‍♀️

- **Smoking History**: A patient's smoking history is a crucial factor in disease risk. Smoking can damage blood vessels, elevate blood pressure, and reduce oxygen delivery to organs, increasing the likelihood of disease. 🚬🚭
